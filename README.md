# Script to find the most common words in the Twitter bios of accounts a user follows

This is a Ruby script that will find what words are used most often in the bios of accounts a user follows on Twitter. I wrote this script because it's a decent way to find what people are interested in. For example, by running the script with [my username](https://twitter.com/tylerpearson), [you can see that I'm interested](https://gist.github.com/tylerpearson/a671dff46920a83eb0d7)) in politics, news, startups, and coding because many of the words are related to it.

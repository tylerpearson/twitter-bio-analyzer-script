# Ruby script to find the most common words in the bios of the accounts a user follows on Twitter

This is a Ruby script that will find what words are used most often in the bios of accounts a user follows on Twitter. I wrote this script because it's a decent way to find what people are interested in.

For example, by running the script with [my Twitter account ](https://twitter.com/tylerpearson), [you can see that I'm interested](https://gist.github.com/tylerpearson/a671dff46920a83eb0d7) in politics, news, startups, and coding because many of the words are related to it.

Here's the top words in bios for the users I follow:
